* Getting started
** Create an online repo (GitHub as example)
** Clone the repo
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sbozzolo/test.git
   #+END_SRC
** Explore the repo
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd test
   ls
   #+END_SRC
** Add a file
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   echo "This is my first file" >> file
   #+END_SRC
** Check out what's happening
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git status
   #+END_SRC
** Add a new file to the tracked ones
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git add file
   #+END_SRC
** Check out what's happening now
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git status
   #+END_SRC
** Commit
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git commit -m "First commit"
   #+END_SRC
   The flag -m means that the subsequent string is to be put as a title
   of the commit. In this case there is only the title.
** Push
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git push origin master
   #+END_SRC
   Origin is always the name of the online repo from where I cloned.
   I can start a repo in an existing folder with git init, in that case
   I have to tell git where is the online repo with git remote add origin.
** Check on GitHub
